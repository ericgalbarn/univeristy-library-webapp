# Thesis Abstract - Corrected Version

This thesis tackles the persistent friction students and staff face when borrowing hard-copy booksâ€”a process still dominated by on-site paperwork and manual record-keeping in many university libraries. We present Bookaholic, a cloud-native Library Management System that relocates every administrative step except physical pick-up into an online, mobile-responsive workflow.

Bookaholic combines automated account verification, cross-device QR-code authentication for enhanced user experience, and real-time availability tracking with an AI-powered recommendation engine that boosts resource discovery. The system features a hybrid recommendation approach utilizing TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity algorithms, complemented by TypeScript-based fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent service availability.

From a business standpoint, the platform demonstrates potential for significant operational improvements through digital transformation. The cloud-native architecture built on Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Python-based machine learning components offers scalable deployment options while maintaining cost-effectiveness compared to traditional proprietary library management systems. A modular, microservices-ready architecture enables multi-institutional roll-out capabilities, aligning with sector-wide digital-transformation mandates while preserving data sovereignty and physical-asset control.

By eliminating paper forms, queue-based reservations, and siloed spreadsheets, Bookaholic demonstrates how targeted automation and machine learning together can modernise academic resource management, with the potential to enhance stakeholder satisfaction across students, librarians, and administrators. The implementation showcases the viability of modern web technologies in addressing traditional library management challenges while providing a foundation for future scalability and feature enhancement.
